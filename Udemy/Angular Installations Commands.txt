Useful Commands:

npm install @angular/cli@latest
ng new [ProjectName]
ng serve or ng s --port 4781
ng generate component [name] or ng g c [name]
ng generate directive [name] or ng g d [name]

You don't need a global install of Angular CLI. It's marginally more tiresome, but certainly less than juggling global installs. Here's the procedure:

Create a new directory and enter it.
There: npm init and (npm i @angular/cli@11.1.12).
Then, instead of ng new myapp, run npx ng new myapp.

Other Way is
npx -p @angular/cli@8 ng new <your_project_name>

Always remember --legacy-peer-deps
